## A.M.P #8 | symbology & characterization

<img src="/covers/symbology-and-characterization-cover.jpg"/>

Permutations of the printed form, reduced and reused plates each one unique and yet floating through the world with siblings. You find solace in the quantity and variation of reality. Where will this take us? Where will we end up? 

The imagery floats from a world adjacent to our reality and our minds reality. A third space intertwinted with spirits and future falitability. We are alive because we are alive.
