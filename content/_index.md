# Agile Meteor Press 

A small press located in a desert oasis. Hyper local focused publishing of the stories of this time and place. 

Agile Meteor Press is a project of Truth or Consequences Contemporary. Our press is focused on sustainable publishing of the rural stories of our small community. Our publishing model is community directed - we aim to use each title to fund the next title we publish. We are focused on the local and on a decisively human scale to bring titles into the world which celebrate the community we thrive in. 

Each edition is concieved as the founding of the next edition. The presales and intital release of the book is designed to recoup the production cost so it may be rolled forward into the next title. 

We publish one book per season based on invitations or submissions. Almost all our books are tangentally related to the physical location of Truth or Consequences, NM - but we take a broad view on just what that means and don't follow any hard or fast rules. 

Agile Meteor Press crafts small editions of work using a dichotomoy of processes. We contract printing out to Bookmoibile in Minneappolis, MN to print larger runs of our titles using state of the art digital printing. Simaltaneously we craft special editions in house using ancient book binding techniques by skilled hands with the help of our community volunteers. This focus on the future while living solidly in the traditions of codex creation which is a hallmark of humans the world over. 

Our personal experiences and emotions define the fabric of a place and we are dedicated to bringing these stories out into the world. We believe in a new resurgance of the hyper local and have created this projec to explore the possiblities of sharing our experience out into the world.

## Inspiration

We have been inspired by many other small publishers found all over the world. Here is a non exhuastive and ever expanding list of places to find magical editions. 

## what is a book?

we've thought long and hard about just what a book is through the process of starting up this press and have come up with the following list of things which make a book a book. 

- page numbers
- entropy

books exist to be touched and therefore they experience decay thoughout their life - but this decay is better to be though of as

- portability
