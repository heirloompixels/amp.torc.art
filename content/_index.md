## Desert Town. Plenty of Water. 

A small press at an oasis. Hyper local focused publishing records of time spanned and place evolving. We craft small beautiful books of unique stories for nomads out there on a rock way out there between those big loving arms of the Milk Way.

Each Being's unique experiences and emotions define collectively the fabric of a place. A history cowritten in the atmosphere and soil of some small bit of planet earth. Hyper local existence transmitted around the world, durably in book form. Agile Meteor Press is an experiemnt into understanding this medium.

The dream is to scream these stories with the ferocity of inked type to planet earth live from our oasis community situated within the rio grande rift. This rift ancient and filled with the historical truth of fossils from all epochs. Dinosaurs on the east bank. Mega Fauna to the west. Primordial waters supplementing earth’s landmass with exoskeleton accumulations: limestone. A consequence of our collective existence enables tall tales real or imagined. Our books etch the stories of this moment on the stratigraphy of anthropocentric culture. We exist. We are important. Libraries shall now enshrine our sagas. There is truth within our consequences. 

An agile meteor adapts to the inevitability of demise: planetary impact. For but a moment it ignites our minds. A dance through the atmosphere sprinkling magic into the mind of all eyes glimpsing this magnificent end. An end realized  after unimaginable time floating aimlessly in empty space. Matter in search of gravity.  Agile Meteor Press collects those stories written out here on the edge of America’s Deserts — espousing the truth’s found at the fringes as we eek out an existence against unlikely desert odds.

Agile Meteor Press crafts small editions of work using a dichotomoy of processes. We contract printing out to Bookmoibile in Minneappolis, MN to print larger runs of our titles using state of the art digital printing. Simaltaneously we craft special editions in house using ancient book binding techniques by skilled hands with the help of our community volunteers. This focus on the future while living solidly in the traditions of codex creation which is a hallmark of humans the world over.

### [Purchase Our Books!](https://shop.torc.art/agile-meteor-press)

Each edition is concieved as the founding of the next edition. The presales and intital release of the book is designed to recoup the production cost so it may be rolled forward into the next title. 

We publish one book per season based on invitations or submissions. Almost all our books are tangentally related to the physical location of Truth or Consequences, NM - but we take a broad view on just what that means and don't follow any hard or fast rules.
