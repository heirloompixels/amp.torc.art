>“The women in the group write fiction, memoir, travelogue, reflection, poem, prayer, rant, manifesto, explanation, jewel-like description and word collage. We write what we please. I could write nonsense and it would be well received. We can do anything in the protected space of our mutual creation.  
>This collection -- inspired and curated by Jessica Logreira -- is a taste of our work. It is the result of a beautiful Truth or Consequences community, one of many that this special place and these special women spawn.”

A perfect description written by Victoria Boynton in the preface to the book.

>"There are unintended consequences - is there an unintended consequence? Can I accidentally become important? I can’t see why I couldn’t experience the consequences of my own consequence. 

>Unintended truth - now that I can imagine. Jotting down a grocery list that, through some mischievous alchemy, becomes a short story about how I hate my mother. “Hate” is such a strong word, but so is “artichoke.” Like, “I could have artichoked her when she said that to my boyfriend.” Is there a counterpart to truth? One truth stands alone, conspicuous. Truths are held to be self-evident, as in all vegetables are created equal. Self-evident means obvious, like “it’s obvious I’m fucked up,” only I’m not. I am art, not choked. I am surrendering to the consequences of truth, accepting my own consequence. What if I am not waiting for wisdom, but Wisdom is waiting for me? What if I am not the receiver of light, but the source? 

>What if I must face the consequences of my own consequence?"
